With  the  evolution  of  cloud  computing,  there  is  an  astounding  need  of  security  solutions.  Some  of  the  primary  considerations here  isbrought on by inappropriate warehousing of data. This particular consideration significantly enhances users' anxiousness and minimizes the adoptability of cloud computing in numerous areas, including the financial industry and governmental agencies. The most effective method to offer risk-free data transfer is via cloud cryptography and storage techniques. Considering this, we propose a new and more secure  algo-rithm  for  the  transmission  of  data  over  the  cloud.  In this  algorithm,  the  data  is  encrypted  and then  split into  two  different parts. Each part is stored in a different cloud. This makes the data challenging for being accessed by any type of hacker, even when ac-cessed it will be of no use to him. This will use three encryption and two decryption keys,hence a combination of symmetric and asym-metric cryptography.
